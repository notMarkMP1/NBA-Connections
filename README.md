As shown in the research article "\textit{Prove them wrong: Do professional athletes perform better when facing their former clubs?}" by Artur Assanskiy, players across all sports are likely to perform better against their former teams in general. A wide set of reasons are provided for why this is the case, ranging from heightened emotions to experience with the team's set plays and strategies. However, this research does not extend the question to how well former teammates individually match up against each other, particularly on different teams than their original. 


Our primary research question is the following: \textbf{Can the strength of a player's relationship to another former teammate inform how well, on average, they perform against each other?}

Our project answers such question, using Pygame for visualizing teammate connections and graph analysis methods to derive a conclusion.
